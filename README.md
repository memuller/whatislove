# What is love

A simple __[LOVE](https://love2d.org/)__ game built as an exercise.

It's supposed to be about shooting stuff with a ship. Some of the stuff shoots back at you.

Project tasks can be found at [it's Trello board](https://trello.com/b/g84l1jMy/what-is-love).

## Running

Run the project with `love .`, as usual.

### Autorunning

You may also run `npm watch` and then Gulp will automagically run the project for you whenever a `.lua` file is updated. This is pretty awesome, and the recommended way to work on this.

This requires installing [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and then, at the project's folder:
```bash
npm install -g gulp-cli
npm install
```

## License
